cvsweb-docker
=============

A ready to use docker image containing cvsweb 3.0.6 (a CVS repository viewer) running on nginx,
with configurable runtime options (such as timezone and gid).

You can use it to quickly and safely expose a web interface to the CVS repositories directory on your host machine.

The Dockerfile uses the cvsweb 3.0.6-8 Debian package which is a patched version of the last release from https://people.freebsd.org/~scop/cvsweb/

Installation
------------

### Option 1: Download image from hub.docker.com ###
You can simply pull this image from docker hub like this:

	docker pull cmanley/cvsweb:debian

If you want to, then you can create a shorter tag (alias) for the image using this command:

	docker tag cmanley/cvsweb:debian cvsweb

With the shorter tag, you can replace the last argument `cmanley/cvsweb-docker` (the image name) with `cvsweb`
in all the `docker run` commands listed under the header *Usage examples*.

### Option 2: Build the image yourself ###

	git clone <Link from "Clone or download" button>
	cd cvsweb-docker
	docker build --rm -t cmanley/cvsweb:debian .

The docker build command must be run as root or as member of the docker group,
or else you'll get the error "permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket".

Usage examples
--------------

Assuming that your cvs repository root directory on the host machine is `/var/lib/cvs`
and has the privileges 750 (user may read+write, group can only read, and others are denied),
and that you want cvsweb be accessible on `127.0.0.1:8080`, then execute one of the commands below.
You may want to place your preferred command in an shell alias or script to not have to type it out each time.

Minimal:

	docker run --name cvsweb -v /var/lib/cvs:/repos:ro -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80/tcp --rm -d cmanley/cvsweb:debian

Recommended use (use the same time zone as the host):

	docker run --name cvsweb \
	-v /var/lib/cvs:/repos:ro \
	-p 127.0.0.1:8080:80 \
	-e TZ=$(</etc/timezone) \
	--rm -d cmanley/cvsweb:debian

Explicitly specify which group id to use for reading the repository, and the timezone:

	docker run --name cvsweb \
	-v /var/lib/cvs:/repos:ro \
	-p 127.0.0.1:8080:80/tcp \
	-e CVSWEB_GID=$(stat -c%g /var/lib/cvs) \
	-e TZ=$(</etc/timezone) \
	--rm -d cmanley/cvsweb:debian

Start container and a shell session within it (this does not start nginx):

	docker run --name cvsweb \
	-v /var/lib/cvs:/repos:ro \
	-p 127.0.0.1:8080:80/tcp \
	--rm -it cmanley/cvsweb:debian /bin/sh

In case of problems, start the container without the --rm option, check your docker logs, and check that the container is running:

	docker logs cvsweb
	docker ps

Stop the container using:

	docker stop cvsweb

Remove the container (in case you didn't run it with the --rm option) using:

	docker rm cvsweb

Runtime configuration
---------------------

You can configure how the container runs by passing some of the environment variables below using the --env or -e option to docker run.
Unless your host's repository is world-readable (which it shouldn't be), then you'll need to at least need to specify CVSWEB_GID.

| name              | description                                                                                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CVSWEB_DEBUG**  | Allowed values: true or false (default).                                                                         |
| **CVSWEB_GID**    | The gid (group id) of the host repository directory. If not given, then the gid of the host volume will be used. |
| **TZ**            | Specify the time zone to use. Default is UTC. In most cases, use the value in the host's /etc/timezone file.     |

Security information
--------------------

* nginx runs as www-data:www-data and forwards requests to fcgiwrap which executes the cvsweb code.
* fcgiwrap runs with uid www-data and with the gid of the CVSWEB_GID environment variable if given, else with gid of the host volume.
* It's important to always protect your host's volume by adding the ":ro" attribute to the docker run -v option as in the examples above.
